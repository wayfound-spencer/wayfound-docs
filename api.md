# API

Wayfound offers APIs to connect your agents to the platform. You can generate an API key on the **API tab** in the **Settings** page. Access to this page requires admin permissions on the Wayfound platform.

[Learn more about implementing Wayfound's APIs here](https://wayfound-api.readme.io/reference/get-agents).
