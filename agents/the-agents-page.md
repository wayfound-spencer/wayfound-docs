# The Agents Page

Wayfound allows you to connect and manage a network of specialized agents. Each agent can perform a focused task, and agents can collaborate to accomplish more complex tasks. The Agents tab displays a list of all agents in your organization. It also allows you to connect and configure new ones.

### View and manage current agents

Opening the agents tab displays a table of agents connected to your organization. Users can **sort** agents by name, platform, last updated date, last published date, and status. Users can also <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 2.35.20 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">**search** for specific agents and <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 2.36.40 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">**filter** by column using buttons in the table's upper-right corner.

In the agents table, the **Actions** column contains a menu of actions that can be opened by clicking the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 11.50.27 AM.png>)button. Within this menu, you can ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 11.49.47 AM.png>)**view agent analytics,** and ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 12.00.44 PM.png>)**activate** or ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 11.49.51 AM.png>)**deactivate agent**.&#x20;

### Onboard an existing agent

Wayfound lets you connect existing external agents to the platform. This includes those built on popular frameworks like LangChain. Adding an agent to Wayfound allows you to track, monitor, and manage it using the Wayfound platform. To connect an agent, you can use the [Wayfound Manager SDK](connecting-agents.md) to import recorded conversations from your external agent.

To onboard an existing agent:

1. Click <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-11-25 at 12.27.06 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top-right corner of the Agents tab.
2. A new menu will appear. Name the agent and explain its role and goal. This information will inform the AI manager's performance evaluation of this agent. Click **Connect**.
