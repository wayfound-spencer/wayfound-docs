The Design tab includes the following customization options:

**Agent Icon**: Choose from a selection of pre-designed icons to represent your agent visually.

**Color**: Select a color scheme for your agent. In your agent's chat interface, the header bar will take this color. In [the-agents-page.md](the-agents-page.md "mention") and [overview.md](../manager/overview.md "mention"), the agent's icon will take on this color.

**Position**: Determine where the agent's chat window will appear on the user's screen. You can choose between left and right positioning to best suit your users' needs and preferences.

**Actions Visible**: By default, agents will notify users when calling other agents. This gives users a better understanding of how their requests are processed. Disable this setting to hide this notification.

**Wayfound Logo**: Choose whether to display the Wayfound logo at the bottom of your agent's interface. This feature is only available to Enterprise customers.

**Agent Shield:** Choose whether to activate Agent Shield for this agent. With Agent Shield, the agent will check each message to ensure if it is safe. If any unsafe content is detected, the agent will block the message and send a message to the user. Note: this will make the agent run slower as it will run this check with each message.

The preview pane on the right will update in real-time to show how your changes will look.
