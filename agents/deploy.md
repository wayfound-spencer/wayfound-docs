# Deploy

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Deploy tab is only available for agents built on Wayfound.
{% endhint %}



Before an agent is deployed for the first time, the deploy page will ask to publish your agent. When you're ready, click **Publish**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only publish your agent when it's ready to interact with customers. We recommend that you thoroughly [test-your-agents.md](test-your-agents.md "mention") before deploying it
{% endhint %}

Once published, the page will display four deployment options.

Wayfound currently offers the following deployment options:

**Launcher Script for Website**: This is a JavaScript snippet that you can embed in your website to add the agent as a chat widget. Users can interact with the agent directly on your site.

**Shared Link**: This is a direct URL to your agent. It's ideal for any situation where you want to provide a quick way to access your agent.

**Embed Link**: This option provides an iframe code snippet. Use this when you want to host the agent directly within a webpage, offering a more integrated experience without using the Launcher script.

**QR Code**: A scannable code that directs users to your agent. This is particularly useful for physical marketing materials, conferences, or anywhere you want to provide quick mobile access to your agent.
