# Definition

The definition page allows you to define your connected agent's key parameters. These parameters are used by the AI Supervisor to evaluate your agent's performance.

A connected agent's parameters include:

**Agent Name:** The name displayed in [the-agents-page.md](the-agents-page.md "mention") and the AI Supervisor's [performance.md](../supervisor/performance.md "mention") reports.

**Role**: The agent's identity; it includes what the agent's job is and what its intended tasks include. During the AI Supervisor's assessment of the agent's performance, it evaluates how well the agent performs its role.

**Goal:** The concrete outcomes intended for the agent's actions. The AI Supervisor will compare the outcomes of the agent's actual interactions with the goals listed here.

**Sentiment Tuning:** Optionally tune sentiment analysis behavior by providing a custom description of how to reason about sentiment for your agent. You can also select if sentiment affects grade. When enabled negative sentiment will lower the agent's grade.

Here, you can also customize the icon and color used to represent the agent on the Wayfound platform.
