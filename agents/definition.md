# Definition

The definition page allows you to define your connected agent's key parameters. These parameters are used by the AI Manager to evaluate your agent's performance.

A connected agent's parameters include:

**Agent Name:** The name displayed in [the-agents-page.md](the-agents-page.md "mention") and the AI Manager's [performance.md](../supervisor/performance.md "mention") reports.

**Role**: The agent's identity; it includes what the agent's job is and what its intended tasks include. During the AI Manager's assessment of the agent's performance, it evaluates how well the agent performs its role.

**Goal:** The concrete outcomes intended for the agent's actions. The AI Manager will compare the outcomes of the agent's actual interactions with the goals listed here.

Here, you can also customize the icon and color used to represent the agent on the Wayfound platform.
