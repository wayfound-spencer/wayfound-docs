# Meetings

When adopting a network of agents approach, each agent in your organization is an expert in particular area of your business. It has a specialized knowledge base and directives tailored to the tasks it has been created to address. It also has a record of its past interactions with users. Meetings allow you to generate insights about more complex topics, including those that may span the expertise of multiple agents, by synthesizing the expertise of multiple agents.

With a meeting of one or more agents, you can combine their knowledge bases and past interactions into a single context. You can set an agenda for each meeting, with questions for the agents to answer collaboratively. When following the agenda, agents use their shared context while interacting according to their individual directives.&#x20;

This process enables an automated but rich exchange of information and perspectives, resulting in comprehensive insights that draw from various aspects of your business operations and customer interactions.
