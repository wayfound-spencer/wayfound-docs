# Key Concepts

### Agents

Wayfound supports specialized agents powered by the latest large language models. Agents are designed to accomplish specific, clearly defined tasks. They can interact with users through text, images, and video formats. They can communicate with other agents for help with answering specific questions, and they can take action or access information in third-party systems. Agents are end-to-end, meaning that they can both interact with users and perform simple workflows. You can connect existing agents built on platforms like LangChain or CrewAI.

### Agent Networks

The best agents are specialized to perform a specific task. Agent networks leverage multiple specialized agents that communicate and collaborate to handle complex tasks. Each agent focuses on its specific expertise while working within the broader network.

### AI Manager

The AI Manager provides centralized oversight of your agent networks, offering network activity insights, agent relationship mapping, and network-wide behavior controls. Learn more in the Manager [overview.md](manager/overview.md "mention") page.

### Performance

The AI Manager continuously evaluates agent performance through user satisfaction metrics, knowledge gap analysis, behavior compliance monitoring, and tool utilization success rates. Learn more in the [performance.md](manager/performance.md "mention") page.

### Guidelines&#x20;

Guidelines inform how the AI Manager evaluates agent performance. Wayfound offers two levels of guidelines: [guidelines.md](agents/guidelines.md "mention") for individual agents and [alignment.md](manager/alignment.md "mention") guidelines that apply across all agents in the organization.

### Actions

Agents can perform actions to help them accomplish their assigned task. Actions include collaboration with other agents on the platform as well as the use of external tools and integrations. Learn more on the [actions.md](agents/actions.md "mention") page.

### Sessions

Sessions provide monitoring capabilities through [recordings.md](sessions/recordings.md "mention") of agent-user interactions and tracking of [link-clicks.md](sessions/link-clicks.md "mention").
