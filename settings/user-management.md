# User Management

Those with admin level permissions can access the Users page in the settings menu. This page displays a table of all users and their statuses. The page also allows you to manage users and their roles in your organization.

### Roles

There are currently two roles on the platform:

**Users** can access the Manager, Agents, Sessions, and Visitors pages. They can create and manage agents and use integrations and actions.

**Admins** have all abilities available to users. They can also access their organization's settings, where they can manage users, add or remove actions and integrations, and view API information.

### Adding Users

You can invite new users by clicking **+ Invite User** at the top-right corner of the page. Enter the new user's email address in the pop-up window to send them an invitation to join the platform. Check the **Admin** box to give them the admin role. When left unchecked, the user will join the organization as a "user."

### Changing a user's status

To change a user's status on the platform, an admin can delete the user and add them again using the same email address. If the user's new role should be admin, make sure to check the **Admin** box.
