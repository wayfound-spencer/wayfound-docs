# Integrations

Wayfound currently offers the following integrations:

**Google Drive Sync**\
Keep your AI agents equipped with the latest information by integrating Google Docs and Sheets with Wayfound. This seamless sync ensures your agents always have up-to-date data, enhancing their accuracy and efficiency. Once connected, you can upload items into an agent's knowledge directly from Google Drive.

**Hubspot**\
Enable your AI agents to create HubSpot contacts when the chat participant provides their email address.

We plan to offer the following integrations and more in the near future: Box, HubSpot, Salesforce, and Web Search. If you have suggestions for additional integrations, please contact us
