# Organizations

### Navigating Organizations (All Users)

An organization is an instance of the platform. Organizations can host multiple users, and every user in an organization can view and manage all of its agents. All users in an organization can also access the organization's currently active tools and integrations.

Customers may want to create multiple organizations on the platform in order to split users and/or agents. Customers can create multiple organizations with an Enterprise plan. To do so, contact Wayfound.

An individual user can also join multiple organizations on the Wayfound platform. If you belong to multiple organizations, you can switch between them without signing out. To do so, hover the mouse over your email at the bottom left corner of the screen. A menu of organizations will appear. Select the organization you wish to use. You can always check which organization you're in by mousing over your name and viewing the menu.



### Organizations settings (Admin only)

Users with admin permissions can view their organization details in the settings menu. In the organizations tab, you can update the company name and view your Customer Support ID, Wayfound Plan, and the amount of Credits used.
