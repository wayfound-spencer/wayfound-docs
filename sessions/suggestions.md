# Suggestions

As you build and deploy AI agents, their interactions with users will scale beyond a level that humans can monitor on their own. To solve this challenge, Wayfound provides an automatic assessment of your AI agents using its AI Manager Agent, which continually monitors and evaluates your agents' interactions.  It provides you with insights about your agents, serving as your interface with AI agents at scale.

### Suggestions components

**Suggested behaviors** are recommendations to improve the quality of an agent's interactions. These recommendations are written as prompts using principles from[#how-to-create-effective-behaviors](../agents/behavior.md#how-to-create-effective-behaviors "mention"). They can be pasted directly into an agent's[behavior.md](../agents/behavior.md "mention") tab.

**Suggested knowledge** identifies gaps in knowledge that, when filled, can enhance the agent's performance. We recommend that you consider each gap and the possible sources of information that can be used to fill them. You can track your progress against each gap by marking filled gaps as **added** on the right-hand side.

### **Suggestion views**

You can customize the suggestions displayed by the Wayfound manager using the drop-down menus at the top-right corner of the window:

You can choose between "Preview," which analyzes interactions using the agents tab (see [test-your-agents.md](../agents/test-your-agents.md "mention")), or  "Published," which analyzes interactions using the published agent interface.
