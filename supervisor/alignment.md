  Guidelines define the oversight and organizational philosophy for all of your
  Agents.

# Alignment

Guidelines are natural-language statements that apply to all of your Agents universally. The AI Manager uses guidelines, in addition to its own judgment, to measure your agents' quality and alignment. These guidelines sit in the middle of a larger, three-level hierarchy of directives. Below organization-level guidelines are [behavior.md](../agents/behavior.md "mention") for individual agents, and above them are system directives, which are set by Wayfound to ensure the performance and reliability across the platform. This hierarchical approach draws from cutting-edge research in the deployment and control of large language models (e.g. [Wallace et al 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13208)).&#x20;

The Global Directives tab comes pre-loaded with example directives. While these directives are recommended by Wayfound, they can be customized or deleted.

New guidelines can be added by clicking **+ Add Global Directive** below the currently active ones. Clicking the button reveals a menu displaying multiple kinds of directives to add:

Use these directives to defines the language, formality level, and general demeanor that all agents share in common. AI interactions should embody. This ensures a consistent brand experience across all conversations with all agents in the organizations.

It guides agents to make decisions and provide responses that align with the company's mission, vision, and values.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 11.56.44 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">**Restrictions/Limitations:** set universal boundaries for all agents in the network. It outlines topics, actions, or information that are off-limits for all AI interactions. This could include prohibitions on discussing confidential information, making commitments on behalf of the company, or engaging in any behavior that could be legally or ethically problematic.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 11.56.52 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">**Custom Command:** implement organization-wide protocols or behaviors that are unique to the company. This could include specific ways of handling certain situations or standard responses to common queries.
