# Getting Started

## **Planning and Building Your Agent**

Before building your agent, carefully plan its purpose and requirements:

1. **Define your use case**: Focus on specific, single-task applications. Keep the scope narrow and let other agents or humans handle different tasks in a larger network of intelligence.
2. **Set clear objectives**: Identify the desired outcomes from agent interactions.
3. **Plan capabilities**: Determine the knowledge, behavior, and tools your agent needs to complete the desired tasks and how to equip the agent with them. Consult [improving-agent-performance.md](improving-agent-performance.md "mention") for more tips.
4. **Build your agent**: Use one of many available agent builders like LangChain. You can also build an agent on Wayfound (see below for instructions).

## Connecting your agents to Wayfound

1. **Add your agent to the platform**: Navigate to [the-agents-page.md](agents/the-agents-page.md "mention"), click **Connect Agent**, and give it a name.
2. **Create an API Key**. Users with admin status can create an API key on the [api.md](api.md "mention") page.
3. **Integrate your agent**: Add Wayfound to your external agent using the [connection.md](agents/connection.md "mention")

## Managing your agent

Once your agent is connected you can use the AI Manager to monitor and improve its performance on the [performance.md](manager/performance.md "mention") page.

1. **Knowledge:** check knowledge gaps and fill them if necessary by adding missing information
2. **User Satisfaction:** Check user satisfaction scores and investigate any low ratings
3. **Issue management:** Examine potential issues raised by the AI Manager
4. **Follow-up analysis:** Delve deeper into agent performance by chatting with the AI Manager. You can start with questions recommended by Wayfound.

## **Using advanced features**

Once your agents are running and managed, you can leverage Wayfound's full capabilities such as:

1. **Interaction-level analysis**: Use Recordings to review specific user conversations.
2. **Engagement tracking**: Monitor Link clicks during agent interactions.
3. **Cross-agent collaboration**: Set up agent meetings to produce organizational insights.

## Don't have an agent yet? You can build one on Wayfound

When using Wayfound's native tools, follow these steps:

1. **Create new agent**: Navigate to [the-agents-page.md](agents/the-agents-page.md "mention") to start a new project. Click the link to build an agent in Wayfound.
2. **Configure the agent**: Add relevant [knowledge.md](knowledge.md "mention") and define the appropriate [behavior.md](agents/behavior.md "mention")
3. **Set up actions**: Implement necessary [actions.md](agents/actions.md "mention") for your use case.
4. **Configure directives**: Add or confirm that your organization's [alignment.md](manager/alignment.md "mention") align with your agent's context.
5. **Customize the visuals**: Use the [design.md](agents/design.md "mention") page to polish the agent's appearance.
6. **Test and refine**: Thoroughly [test-your-agents.md](agents/test-your-agents.md "mention") before publication.
